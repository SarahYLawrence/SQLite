# SQLite
## Overview
The PDF provided shows the final results of this SQL command along with some relational algebra and calculus. Note that some of the files for this repository had to be shortened. The results on the PDF provided are with the full information not the shortened information. 

The relational algebra and calculus answers are based on the following queries:
- a. paper ids of all papers that have cited the paper with id ‘2107.06267’
- b. title and submitter of papers with cs.DC category, that are not cited by other papers

All the steps to help someone set up a database and run the SQL command on their own are in the "Database Setup.md" file under the main tab. Note that with the CSV files provided it is not necessary to run the code used to create the CSV, but it is still there for curious minds.
