# SQLite
## Overview
The PDF provided shows the final results of this SQL command along with some relational algebra and calculus. Note that some of the files for this repository had to be shortened. These results are with the full information not the shortened information. 

For the following queries
a. paper ids of all papers that have cited the paper with id ‘2107.06267’
b. title and submitter of papers with cs.DC category, that are not cited by other papers

All the steps to help someone set up a database and run the SQL command on their own are under the main "Database Setup.md". Note that with the CSV files provided it is not necessary to run the provided code to create them, but is still there for curious minds.
